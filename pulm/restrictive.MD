# Restrictive Lung Disease
* restricted from filling the lung
* presents with a decrease in TLC, FVC, and FEV1 on spirometry with an increase in the FEV1:FEV ratio to > 80%
* most commonly due to interstitial disease of the lung but may also arise with chest wall abnormalities such as obesity
	* thickening of the wall of the alveoli

## Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
* fibrosis of the interstitum
* occurs due to cyclical lung injury 
	* cyclical healing due to TGF-beta from injured pneumocytes induces fibrosis
	* can be secondary to amiodarone or radiation therapy 
* clinical features:
	* progressive dyspnea and cough
	* fibrosis on lung CT
* treatment is lung transplanation 

## Pneumoconioses
* interstitial fibrosis due to occupationla exposure
* requires chronic exposure to small particles that are fibrogenic

### Coal Workers'
* carbon dust exposure
* leads to black-lung and rheumatoid arthritis (Caplan syndrome) 
* mild buildup is anthracosis (caused by pollution)

### Silicosis
* silica beads exposure stops macrophages from working as well 
* leads to fibrotic nodules in **upper lobes** of the lung and an increased risk for TB

### Berylliosis
* beryllium exposure leads to noncaseating franulomas in the lung
	* also causes hilar lymph nodes, and systemic organs 
* very similar to sarcoidosis 
* increases the risk for lung cancer

### Asbestosis
* asbestos fibers causes fibrosis of the lung or pleura or cancer of the lung or pleura 
* asbestos bodies are clear

## Sarcoidosis
* granulomas lead to restricted filling of the lung
* systemic disease mostly seen in African American females
* etiology is unkown but is likely due to CD4+ helper T-cell response to unkown antigens
* granulomas can also effect the:
	* uvea (uveitis)
	* skin (cutaneous nodules)
	* salivary glands and lacrimal glands (mimics **Sjogren's Syndrome**)
	* almost any tissue 
* clinical features:
	* dyspnea or cough
	* elevated serum ACE
	* hypercalcemia
		* due to granulomas that can activate vitamin D
	* treatment is steroids, often resolves spontanouesly without treatment

## Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
* granulomatous reaction to inhaled organic antigen 
* presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea
	* resolves with antigen removal 
* chronic exposure leads to intersitital fibrosis
