# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
* characterized by obstruction to getting air out of the lung 
* manifests as changes in **spirometry**
	* decrease in FVC, substantial decrease in FEV1
		* normal FVC is 5L, 4L is FEV1
		* in COPD we 4L, 2L
	* results to decreased FEV1:FVC ratio
	* increase in TLC as there is air trapped in the lung
		* normal is 7L

## Chronic Bronchitis
* chronic productive cough lasting at least 3 months over a minimum of 2 years
* HIGHLY associated with smoking
* bronchus epithelium 
	* pseudo-stratified, cilliated respiratory epithelium lines the lumen of the bronchus
	* lamina propria is proximal to blood vessels that can warm the air before it reaches the alveoli 
	* underneath this is the sub-mucosa which has mucinous glands
	* underneath this is the mucosa
* smoking brings in a ton of polutant which leads to an increase in mucous production in response (mucosal gland hypertrophy) 
	* >50% is chronic bronchitis (Reid index normally < 40%)
	* some of the mucous goes back and plugs the airways 
* clincal features:
	* productive cough
	* cyanosis: increase in PaCO2, and decrease in PaO2
	* increased risk of infection and cor pulmonale
		* anytime there is a blockage in a tube, there is an increase in infection
		* clamping down of the blood everywhere leads to increased RH workload aka cor pulmonale 

## Emphysema
* destruction of the alveolar air sacks leads to **obstruction**
	1. loss of elastic recoil prevents oxygen from being snapped into the blood vessels
	2. bernouli principle causes the bronchoile to clamp shut when air rushes out, but this is counteracted by the elastic recoil of the alveoli normally (and by cartilidge in the URT). This is lost in emphysema
* leads to a spongy appearance as the alveoli combine
* occurs due to an imbalance between proteases and antiproteases
	* alveolar macrophage eats particulate matter that reaches the terminal bronchi leading to inflammation (common)
	* inflammation produces proteases which normally damage the body but the lung produces a1AT (antiprotease) in order to counteract this
	* overproduction of proteases or decreased production of antiproteases can cause emphysema
		* **smoking** causes an increase in proteases
			* causes centriacinar emphysema in smoking 
		* **a1AT deficiency** causes a decrease in antiproteases
			* panacinar emphysema occurs in a1AT def
			* protein accumulates in liver instead of moving into the blood, causing liver cirrhosis 
				* PAS positive globules
			* PiM/PiM is the normal
				* PiZ is a clinically relavent that causes accumulation in the ER of hepatocytes
				* PiZZ leads to panacinar emphyzema
* clinical features:
	* dyspnea and cough with minimal sputum (not much mucus production) 
	* prolonged expiration with pused lips (pink puffer)
		* needed to force the walls open
	* weight loss caused by the above extra breathing
	* increased AP diameter of chest (barrel chest)
		* opposite of fibrosis
* late complications
	* hypoxemia
		* eventually there is a loss of the blood vessels in the crappy air sacs
	* cor pulmonale

## Asthma
* reseversible airway bronchoconstriction most commonly due to allergic stimuli (type 1 hypersensitivity) 
* presents in childhood with other allergic conditions like thinitis, eczema, and family history of atopic reactions
* pathogenesis:
	1. genetically susceptible individual is exposed to allergen
	2. Th2 phenotype of CD4+ T cells is induced and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 is released 
		* IL4 allows class switching to IgE
		* IL5 calls eosinophils
		* induces production of Th2 helper T-cells (attenuates Th1)
	3. IgE mediates activation of mast cells 
		* dumps preformed histamine granules (at the venules) leading to histamine-induced vasodilation and histamine-induced vascular permeability (post cappilary venules)
	4. IgE mediates inflammation by leukotrines, B4, D4 causing bronchocontstrictions
* nonallergic causes of asthma:
	* exercise
	* viral infection
	* aspirin
	* occupational stimulants 
* clinically features:
	* episodic base d on allergen exposure
	* dyspnea and wheezing 
	* productive cough, curschmann spirals admixed with Charot-Leyden crystals
	* status asthmaticus is extreme attack that can lead to death 

## Bronchiextasis
* permanent dilation of the bronchioles and bronchi 
* loss of airway tone results in airway trapping
	* turbulent airway flow
* pathogenesis is due to necrotizing inflammation with damage to the airway walls which can be caused by:
	* cystic fibrosis
	* kartagener syndrome
		* cilia are not functioning properly
	* tumor or foreign body
	* necrotizing infection 
	* allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
		* hyperssensitivity reaction to aspergillis
* clinical features 
	* cough, dyspnea, and foul-smelling sputum
	* complications include hypoxemia with cor pulmonale and secondary amyloidosis
		* SAA --> AA deposits
