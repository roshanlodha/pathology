# Pulmonary Hypertension
* clinical features:
	* atherosclerosis of the pulmonary trunk
	* smooth muscle hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries
	* intimal fibrosis
	* **plexiform lesions** are seen with severe, long-standing disease
		* tuft or group of capillaries
	* **exertional dyspnea** and RH failure 
* causes RV hypertrophy and cor pulmonale 
* primary pulmonary hypertension has an unknown etiology
	* clasically seen in young adult females
	* familial form are related to inactivating mutation of BMPR2 and leads to proliferation of vascular smooth muscle 
* secondary pulmonary hypertension is due to hypoxemia (e.g. through COPD or interstitial lung disease) or increased pulmonary flow (e.g. through congenital heart disease -- **eisenmenger syndrome**)
	* may also arise with recurrent pulmonary embolism

# Respiratory Distress Syndromes

## ARDS
* damage to the alveolar-cappilary interface leads to leaking of protein into airsac which is reorganized into a hyline membrane 
	* gas exchange is limited
	* diffuse collapse of lung due to increased elasticity visible on CXR
* etiology:
	* tons
	* commonly sepsis, infection, shock, trauma, aspiration, pancreatitis, DIC, 
	hypersensitivity reaction, and drugs
	* **activation of neutrophils induces protease-mediated and FR damage of type I and II pneumocytes**
* treatment:
	* address underlying cause
	* ventilation with PEEP (+ end-expiratory pressure)
		* PEEP prevents alveoli from fully closing
	* recovery may be complicated by interstitial fibrosis (due to loss of T2pneumocytes)

## NRDS
* respiratory distress due to inadequate surfactant levels (produced by T2pneumocytes)
* clinical features:
	* increasing respiratory effort after birth leading to tachypnea and use of accessory mucles
	* hypoxemia with cyanosis
	* diffuse granularity of lung on CXR 
* etiology:
	* prematurity (L:S ratio is predictive)
		* < 1.5 is BAD
	* C-section delivery (steroids are released in a normal delivery which induces surfactant production)
	* maternal diabetes (insulin inhibits surfactant)
* complications:
	* hypoxemia increases risk of PDA persistence and necrotizing enterocolitis
	* supplemental oxygen (treatment) increases risk of free radical injury
		* injury to retina or bronchopulmonary dysplasia
