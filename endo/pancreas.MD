# Endocrine Pancreas
* composed of clusters of cells termed islets of Langerhans
	* each islet consists of multiple cell types, each producing one type of hormone
	* insulin is secreated by beta cells that lie in the center of the islets 
		* insulin upregulated GLUT4 receptors 
	* insulin is opposed by glucagon, which is synthesized by the alpha cells
		* promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis to increased blood sugar 
## Type 1 DM
* insulin deficiency leads to a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia
* caused by an autoimmune destruction of beta cells by T lymphocytes leading to inflammation of the islets
* associated with HLA-DR3 and DR4
* can have autoantibodies against insulin that can be seen years before clinical disease 
* manifests in childhood with features of insulin deficiency:
	* high serum glucose
	* weight loss, low muscle mass, polyphagia
	* polyuria, polydipsia, glycosuria
* treatment is life long insulin
### Diabetic Ketoacidosis
* excessive serum ketoacids
* often arises with stress such as infection
* epinephrine increases glucagon levels with exacerbate lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis 
	* increased lipolysis leads to increased free fatty acids (FFAs)
	* liver converts FFAs into ketone bodies
* clinical features:
	* hyperglycemia (> 300 mg/dL)
	* anion gap metabolic acidosis
	* hyperkalemia
	* Kussmaul respirations, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and fruity smelling breath 
* treatment:
	* fluids
	* insulin
	* replacement of electrolytes (specifically potassium due to insulin promoting uptake of K+)
## Type 2 DM
* end-organ insulin resistance leading to metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia
* most common type of DM and rising incidence 
* arises in middle-aged, obese adults 
	* obesity decreases insulin receptors on adipose tissue
	* strong genetic predisposition 
* insulin levels are increased early in disease with a following insulin deficiency due to beta cell exhaustion
* histology reveals amyloid deposition in islets 
* clinical features:
	* polyuria
	* polydipsia
	* hyperglycemia
	* can be clincally silent 
* diagnosis:
	* random blood glucose > 200
	* fasting glucose > 126
	* glucose tolerance test > 200 two hrs after glucose load 
* treatment:
	* weight loss
	* drug therapy to counter insulin resistance
	* insulin 
* risk for hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma
	* high glucose levels (> 500) leads to life-threatening diuresis
	* hypotension and coma follow
	* ketones are absent 
## Complication of DM
* non-enzymatic glycosylation of vascular basement membrane
	* NEG of large and medium-sized vessels leads to atheroscelrosis
	* NEG of small vessels leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis 
		* glomerolonephritis
		* diffuse sclerosis --> chronic renal failure
	* NEG of hemoglobin leads to HbA1C
* osmotic damage in certain cells that take up sugar sans insulin
	* schwann cells 
		* aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol which increases osmosis into schwann cells 
		* leads to neuropathy
	* pericytes of retinal blood vessels
		* weakens blood vessel walls leading to aneurysms (in retina)
	* lens leading to cataracts
## Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors
* tumors of the islet cells
* often a component of MEN1 along with PT hyperplasia and pituitary adenoma 
### Insulinoma
* episodic hypoglucemia with mental status changes that are relieved with glucose
* decreased glucose, increased insulin, increased C-peptide 
### Gastinoma
* increased production of gastrin promotes stomach acid production 
* treatment resistant peptic ulcers such as zolinger ellison syndrome
* may be multiple and can extend into jejunum 
### Somatostatinoma
* somatostatin inhibits gastrin and cholecystokinin
* leads to low acid production (achlorhydria)
* cholelithiasis and steatorrhea 
### VIPoma
* tumor that produces excessive VIP which inhibits gastic acid
* watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria
