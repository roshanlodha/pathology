# Thyroid Gland
### Thyroglossal Duct Cyst
* thyroid develops at the base of the tongue and decends along this duct
* cystic dilation of thryglossal duct remnant
* presents as an anterior neck mass 
### Lingual Thyroid
* persistance of thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue
* presents as a base of tongue mass
## Hyperthyroidism
* increased level of circulating thyroid hormone
	* increases basal metabolic rate
		* increases N-K-ATPase
	* increases sympathetic nervous system activity 
		* beta-1 driven
* clinical features:
	* weight loss despite increased appetite
	* heat intolerance and sweating
	* tachycardia with increased cardiac output
	* arrhythmia (a-fib)
	* tremor, anxiety, insomnia, heightened emotions 
	* hypocholesterolemia and hyperglycemia
	* many, many, more
### Grave's Disease
* IgG autoantibody that stimulates TSH receptor
	* increases synthesis and release of thyroid hormone
* occurs in women of childbearing age and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism
* clinical features:
	* hyperthyroidism
	* diffuse goiter
	* exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema
* labs:
	* increase and free T4
	* decreased TSH 
		* T4 downregulates TRH receptors in AP
	* hypocholesterolemia
	* increased serum glucose 
* treatment:
	* beta-blockers
	* thioamide
		* blocks peroxidase, blocking coupling and organification in thyroid of TG and iodide
	* radioiodine ablation 
#### Thryoid Storm
* feared complication of Grave's Disease
* elevated catecholamines and massive hormone excess due to stress
* leads to arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and vomiting with hypovolemic shock
* treated with PTU, beta-blockers, and steroids
	* PTU inhibits peroxidase mediated coupling and organification and peripheral conversion of T4 --> T3
### Multinodular Goiter
* enlarged thyroid gland with multiple nodules due to relative I- deficiency
* usually nontoxic
	* rarely, regions become TSH-independent (toxic goiter)
## Hypothyroidism
### Cretinism
* hypothyroidism in neonates and infants 
* clinical features:
	* mental retardation (thyroid hormones are vital for normal brain development)
	* short stature (thyroid hormone is vital for skeltal development)
	* coarse facial features
	* enlarged tongue
	* umbilical hernia
* causes:
	* maternal hypothyroidism during early pregnancy
	* thyroid agenesis
	* dyshormonogenetic goiter (thyroid peroxidase deficiency)
	* I- deficiency 
### Myxedema
* hypothyroidism in older children and adults
* clinical features:
	* myxedema
		* deepend voice and enlargement of the tongue 
	* weight gain despite normal appetite
	* slowing of mental activity
	* muscle weakness
	* cold intolerance and decreased sweating
	* bradycardia
	* hypercholesterolemia 
* causes:
	* Hashimoto Thyroiditis
		* most common cause
	* I- deficiency
	* drugs
		* lithium
	* surgical removal of radioablation of thyroid 
## Thyroiditis
### Hashimoto Thyroiditis
* autoimmune destruction of thyroid gland
* associated with HLA-DR5 
* most common cause of thyroidism when I- levels are sufficient
* clinical features
	* initially hyperthyroidism (due to destruction of gland and leakage of thyroid hormones)
	* progresses into hypothyroidism with decreased T4 and elevated TSH
* increased B-cell lymphoma risk
### Subacute (deQuervian) Granulomatous Thyroiditis
* granulomatous thyroiditis that follows a viral infection
* presents as a tender thyroid with transient hyperthyroidism 
	* self-limit and does not progress to hypothyroid state 
### Reidel Fibrosing Thyroiditis
* chronic inflammation with extensive fibrosis of thyroid
* presents as hypothyroidism with hard, nontender thyroid gland
* fibrosis may extend to local structures such as the airway
* clasically a young female 
	 * **anaplastic carcinoma** should be considered for patients in their 70s 
## Thyroid Neoplasia
* tumor within the thyroid
* usually presents as a distinct, *solitary* nodule
* thyroid nodules are more likely to be benign than malignant
* can be diagnosed via radioactive I-131 uptake study
	* increased uptake can be seen in Graves or nodular goiter
	* decreased uptake is seen in adenoma and carcinoma and warrants a biopsy 
* papillary, follicular, medullary, anaplastic (M-FAP)
### Follicular Adenoma 
* benign tumor of follicular glands surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule
* usually nonfunction but rarely may secrete thyroid hormone
### Papillary Carcinoma
* most common type of thyroid cancer at 80%
* exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood in major risk factor
	* such as radiation for acne 
* histology
	* (usually) papillary, finger-like projections 
	* white clearing at the center of nuclei (Orphan Annie-eyed nuclei)
	* nuclear grooves
	* psammoma body
* classically spreads to the cervial lymph nodes but has an excellent prognosis
### Folicular Carcinoma
* malignant proliferation of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule
	* there will be invasion of follices through the capsule 
* FNA cannot distinguish between carcinoma and adenoma
* metastasis generally occurs hematogenously 
### Medullary Carcinoma
* malignant proliferation of parafollicular C cells (C cells produce c-alcitonin)
	* leads to hypocalcemia
* calcitonin deposits within the tumor as amyloid 
* histology shows malignant cells in an amyloid stroma 
* familial cases are associated with **MEN2A** and **MEN2B** (multiple endocrine neoplasia)
	* associated with mutations in the RET oncogene
		* detection of RET mutations warrants prophylactic thyroidectomy 
### Anaplastic Carcinoma
* undifferentiated malignant tumor of thyroid usually seen in the elderly
* often invades local structures leading to dysphagia or respiratory compromise
* poor prognosis that presents with similar to Reidel Fibrosing Thyroiditis
