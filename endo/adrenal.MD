# Adrenal Cortex
* all hormones are derived from cholesterol 
* composed of three layers: GFR
	* layer G: generates aldosterone for salt maintainance
	* layer F: generates cortisol
	* layer R: generates androgens
## Cushing Syndrome
* excess cortisol
* clincial features:
	* muscle weakness with thin extremities
		* high gluconeogenesis 
	* moon facies, buffalo hump, and truncal obesity
		* high gluconeogenesis --> excess insulin release --> fat storage
	* abdominal striae
		* ruptured blood vessels 
	* HTN 
		* cortisol regulates alpha-1 receptors on arterioles to increase sensitivity to norepinephrine
	* osteoporosis 
	* immune suppression
		* inhibits phospholipase A2
		* inhibits IL-2
		* inhibits release of histamine from mast cells
* diagnosis is by increased 24 hour urine cortisol levels 
* causes:
	1. excess corticosteroids (iatrogenic)
		* leads to bilateral atrophic adrenal glands
	2. primary adrenal adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma
		* unilateral hyperplasia + unilateral atrophy
	3. ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma
		* bilateral hyperplasia
	4. paraneoplastic ACTH secretion 
		* bilateral hyperplasia
* high dose dexamethasone (ACTH analog) can help distinguish between 3 and 4:
	* supresses ACTH production by pituitary adenoma 
	* fails to suppress extopic ACTH production by paraneoplasm
## Hyperaldosteronism
* excess aldosterone (which influences late distal tubule)
	* principal cell takes in Na+ and release K+
	* alpha-intercalated cell releases H+ 
* clinical features:
	* hypernatremia (principal cells)
	* hypokalemia (principal cells)
	* metabolic alkalosis (alpha-intercalated cells)
	* hypertension secondary to hypernatremia
### Primary Hyperaldosteronism
* most commonly due to an adrenal adenoma
* sporadic hyperplasia and carcinoma
* characterized by high aldosterone and **low renin**
	* hypernatremia leads to increased blood volume, which signals downregulation of RAAS system by kidney
### Secondary Hyperaldosteronism 
* secondary to activation of RAAS system 
* JGA activation secondary to renovascular hypertension leads to increases renin
	* renin converts angiotensinogen to AT1
	* AT2 eventually activates aldosterone production in adrenal gland 
## Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
### 21-hydroxylase deficiency 
* most common cause
* 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of mineralocorticoids and cortisol 
* steroidogenesis is shunted towards sex steroid production
	* deficiency in aldosterone (mineralocorticoid)
		* salt-wasting and K+ holding 
			* hyponatremia and hyperkalemia 
				* hypovolemia secondary to hyponatremia 
		* **11-hydroxylase** deficiency would *not* have features of mineralocorticoid deficiency 
		* **17-hydroxylase** is necessary for shunting towards cortisol and sex steroids
			* 17-hydroxylase deficiency would leads to clinical findings of elevated mineralocorticoids with no cortisol or sex steroids 
	* deficiency in cortisol
		* life-threatening hypotension 
		* cortisol depletion leads to increased ACTH and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 
	* increase in sex hormone
		* leads to clitoral enlargement (female) or precocious puberty (male)
## Adrenal Insufficiency
* lack of adrenal hormones
	* acute is typicall due to **Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome**
		* arises in young child with N. meningitis infection with DIC and bilateral necrosis of both adrenal glands 
		* acute lack of cortisol exasterbates hypotension 
### Chronic Insufficiency
* progression destruction
1. **autoimmune destruction** 
2. **TB**
3. **metastatic carcinoma** 
* clinical features:
	* hyponatremia (with hypotension and hypovolemia), hyperkalemia
	* weakness 
	* hyperpigmentation
	* vomiting and diarrhea 
# Adrenal Medulla 
* composed of neural crest-derived chromaffin cells
* main physiologic source of catecholamines
## Pheochromocytoma
* (brown) tumor of the chromaffin cells 
* clinical features:
	* episodic HTN, headaches, palpitations, tachycardia, and sweating
	* diagnosed by increased serum metanephrines and increased 24 hour urine metanephrines and VMA
* treatment is surgical excision 
	* patients are given phenoxybenzamine before excission to prevent leaked epinephrine and norepinephrine from causing damage 
* rules of 10:
	* 10% bilateral
	* 10% familial
	* 10% malignant
	* 10% located outside the adrenal medulla 
		* can be the bladder wall
* associations:
	* MEN2A and MEN2B
	* VHL disease
	* NF-1
