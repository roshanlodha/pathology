# Parathyroid Pathology
* cheif cells in PT gland regulate serum free calcium (Ca2+) levels via PTH secretion
	* 60% of calcium is bound to proteins
	* some more is bound to phosphate
* low levels of Ca2+ lead to release of PTH which:
	* increases bone osteoclast activity
	* increases small bowel absorption of Ca2+ and PO4- via vitamin D
	* increases renal reabsorption of Ca2+
	* decreases renal reabsorption of PO4- 
		* this step in particular increases **free, ionized** Ca2+
## Primary Hyperparathyroidism
* excess PTH due to PT gland disorder
* most common cause is a PT adenoma 
	* benign neoplasm usually involving one gland
	* most often results in asymptomatic hypercalcemia
* other causes include sporadic hyperplasia and PT carcinoma 
* consequences of increased PTH and hypercalcemia include:
	* nephrolithiasis (Ca2+ kidney stones)
	* nephrocalcinosis (metastatic calcification of tissue)
	* CNS disturbances (depression and seizures)
	* constipation, peptic ulcer disease, acute pancreatitis (Ca2+ is an enzyme activator)
	* osteitis fibrosa cystica (massive resorption of bone)
* lab findings:
	* increase PTH
	* increased Ca2+
	* decreased PO4-
	* increased urinary cAMP
	* increased Alk Phos 
* treatment is surgical removal
## Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
* excess production of PTH due to a disease outside of PT gland
* most common cause is chronic renal failure
	* decreased PO4- excresion --> binds to Ca2+ --> decreased Ca2+ stimulated increased PTH
	* increased PTH leads to bone resorption
* lab findings
	* increased PTH
	* decreased Ca2+
	* increased PO4-
	* increased alk phos
## Hypoparathyroidism
* low PTH due to autoimmune damage, surgical excision, and DiGeorge syndrome 
* clinical features:
	* low PTH and serum Ca2+
	* numbness and tingling 
	* tetany
## Psuedohypoparathyroidism
* due to end-organ resistance to PTH
* hypocalcemia with elevated PTH levels
* autosomal dominant form is associated with short stature and short 4th and 5th digits
	* defective Gs protein prevents conversion of ATP to cAMP via Adenyl cyclase
