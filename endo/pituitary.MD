# Anterior Pituitary Gland
* benign tunmor of the anterior pituitary cells
* may be functional (produces hormones) or nonfunctional (does not produce hormones)
	* nonfunctional tumors present with mass effect
		* push against optic chiasm leading to **bitemporal hemianopsia** (loss of peripheral vision)
		* hypopituitarism
		* headache
	* functioning tumors present with features based on the hormone produced
## Pituitary Adenomas
### Prolactinoma
* most commonly produced hormone and thus anterior pituitary tumor
* clinical presentation:
	* galactorrhea and amenorrhea in females
		* prolactin inhibits GnRH which inhibits LH and FSH leading to amenorrhea
	* decreased libido and headache in men
		* males do not have lobular units in their breast meaning they will not have galactorrhea
* treatment:
	* dopamine agonists
		* dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion
		* bromocriptine (doapmine agaonist)
	* surgery 
### Growth Hormone Adenoma
* Gigantism in children 
	* children have not yet fused their epyphesial growth plate so there will be linear growth of bone
* acromegaly (enlargement of bones of the hand, feet, and jaw) in adults
	* cardiac failure is a common cause of death in these patients
* often leads to secondary diabetes 
	* because GH inhibits glucose uptake into cells leading to a secondary diabetes
* diagnosis:
	* elevated GH and IGF-1 
		* growth hormone travels to the liver to cause increased production of IGF-1
			* IGF is what actually mediates the growth of tissues 
	* oral glucose will **not** supress GH release in these patients
* treatment:
	* octreotide
		* normal: GH release hormone (GHRH) tells anterior pituitary to release GH
		* with medication: somatostatin-inhibitor; hence blocks AP release of GH
	* GH receptor antagonists 
	* surgery
### Others
* **ACTH cell adenoma** causes Cushing Syndrome
* TSH cell, LH-producing, and FSH-producing adenomas are rare 
## Hypopituitarism
* insufficient production of hormones by the anterior pituitary
	* symptoms don't arise until >75% of the AP is lost
* causes:
	* pituitary adenoma (adults) via mass effect
	* craniopharyngioma (children) via mass effect
	* Sheehan syndrome
		* during pregnancy, the pituitary doubles in size due to increased demand for hormones
		* blood supply does not increase, however, which increases liklihood of infarction
		* associated with a **loss of pubic hair**
			* pubic hair arises due to LH, which arises from the anterior pituitary
	* Empty sella syndrome
		* sellac tursica is empty meaning the pituitary is missing
		* causes:
			* secondary truama
			* congential defect 
# Posterior Pituitary Gland
* ADH and oxytocin are produced in the hypothalamus and then released by the posterior pituitary
	* ADH regulates free water in the *distal tubues* of the collecting ducts
	* oxytocin controls uterine contractions and release of breast milk
## Central Diabetes Insipidus
* diabetes means that someone is urinating too much
* central means **ADH deficiency**
* can be due to hypothalamic or posterior pituitary pathology 
* clinical features:
	* polyuria and polydipsia (drinks a lot as a response)
	* hypernatremia and high serum osmolality due to loss of free water 
	* low urine osmolality and specific gravity 
* diagnosis is made by failure of water deprevation to increase urine osmolality
* treatment:
	* demopressin (ADH analog)
## Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
* impaired renal disponse to ADH causes someone to urinate too muhc
* can be use to inherited mutations or drugs 
	* lithum and endomethylcycline
* clinical features are similar to central diabetes indipidus without response to desmopressin 
## SIADH
* excessive ADH secretion
* clinical features
	* hyponatremia and low serum osmolality due to water retention 
	* mental status change and seizures 
* causes:
	* ectopic production (such as small cell carcinoma of lung which produces ADH)
	* CNS truama
	* pulmonary infection
	* drugs (cyclophosphamide)
* treatment:
	* free water restriction
	* demeclocycline
