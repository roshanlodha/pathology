# Vulva
* skin external to vagina
## Bartholin Cyst
* obstruction of duct feeding bartholin gland leads to cystic dilatation 
	* adjacent to vaginal canal; lower vestible 
* typically unilateral and painful; in women of reproductive age 
	* related at reproductive age as it is related to infection
* further destruction can lead to abcess
## Condyloma
* most commonly due to HPV 6 or 11
	* HPV infects lower genital tract (vulva, vaginal canal, cervix)
		* low risk vs high risk based on DNA of HPV
			* low risk: 6, 11
				* rarely progresses to carcinoma 
				* warty neoplasm of vulvar skin (can be large)
			* high risk: 16, 18, 31, 33
				* higher risk of progression
				* leads to dysplasia and eventually cancer 
	* HPV causes **koilocytic change**
		* looks like a raisin
## Lichen Sclerosis
* thinning of epidermis and fibrosis of dermis
* presents with leukoplakia (white plaque) with parchment-like vulvar skin 
* most commonly seen in postmenopausal women 
* benign, associated with slight risk of squamous cell carcinoma
### Lichen Simplex Chronicus
* **hyperplasia** of vulvar squamous epithelium
* leukoplakia with **thick, leathery** vulvar skin
* associated with chronic irritation and scratching
* benign; no increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma 
## Vulvar Carcinoma
* cancer usually arises from squamous epithelium lining the vulva
* **very** rare, accounting for only a small % of female genital cancers 
	* presents as leukoplakia 
		* biopsy distinguishes from Lichen s%20
* can form through HPV or non
	* high risk HPV (16/18) causes Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) which causes displasia and eventually carcinogenesis
		* 40-50 years of age
	* non-HPV related is caused by long-standing **lichen sclerosis**
		* > 70 years of age
## Extramammary Paget Disease
* malignant epithelial cells in the epidermis of the vulva
* presents as an erythematous, prutitic, ulcerated skin
* represents carcinoma in situ, usually no underlying carcinoma 
* stain used to distinguish from melenoma:
	* Paget cells: PAS+, keratin+, S100-
		* keratin is an intermediate filament of epithelial cells; epithelial cells == carcinoma 
		* PAS marks mucous (which only epithelial cells can do)
	* Melanoma cells: PAS-, keratin-, S100+
