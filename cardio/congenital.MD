# Congenital Defects 
* usually arise sporadically during embryogenesis (weeks 3-8)
* seen in 1% of live births
* often results in L-R or R-L shunting 
## Ventricular Septal Defect
* defect in the septum that divides right and left ventricles
	1. results in L-R shunting due to lower pressure of RV 
	2. increased blood volume in pulmonary circuit 
	3. pulmonary hypertension
	4. eventually the LV pressure lowers enough to cause R-L shunting causing cyanosis 
* large defects leads to Eisenmenger syndrome (RV hypertrophy)
* associated with **fetal alcohol syndrome**
* treament:
	* small defects may close spontaneously
	* larger ones require surgical closure
## Atrial Septal Defect
* defect in the septum that divides right and left atria 
* most common type is **ostium secundum**
	* ostium primum type is associated with Down syndrome
* results in a R-L shunt with a split S2 sound due to delayed closure of pulmonic valve
	* delayed closure of pulmonic valve relative to aortic leads to splitting of S2
	* can cause paradoxical embolus 
## Patent Ductus Arteriosis 
* associated with congenital rubella 
* failure of the ductus arteriosus to close (PDA connects the aorta to the pulmonary curcuit)
	1. blood flowing into aorta flows into the pulmonary curcuit
	2. leads to pulmonary hypertension
	3. eventually same progression as VSD of Eisenmenger syndrome leading to lower extremity cyanosis
* presentation:
	* L-R is asymptomatic at birth with a holosystolic, machine-like murmur
* treatment:
	* indomethacin (decrease PGE which results in PDA closure)
## Tetralogy of Fallot
1. stenosis of RV outflow tract 
2. right ventricular septal hypertophy
3. VSD
4. aorta that overrides the VSD 
clinical presentation:
* stenosis of RV outflow to pulmonary curcuit and aorta that overrides VSD leads to R-L shunt 
* leads to cyanosis, squatting relieves cyanosis 
* boot shaped heart on x-ray
## Transposition of the Great Vessels
* aorta comes off of RV and pulmonary circuit comes off of LV leading to two independent curcuits
* treatment:
	 * PGE keeps the PDA open until surgery can be performed 
## Truncus Arteriosus
* single large vessel arising from both ventricles due to failure of the truncus to divide
* presentation:
	* early cyanosis
	* deoxygenated blood from RV mixes with oxygenated blood from LV before pulmonary and aortic circulation seperate
## Tricuspid Atresia 
* tricupid valve ofifice fails to develop
* RV is hypoplastic
* associated with ASD which results in R-L shunting and early cyanosis 
## Coarctation of the Aorta
* narrowing of the aorta 
### Infantile
* associated with PDA and Turner syndrome
* coarctation lies distal to the aortic arch, but proximal to the PDA 
	* this leads to lower pressure in distal aortic arch, causing R-L shunting
* presents as lower extremity cyanosis 
### Adult
* not assoicated with PDA so there is a coarctation distal to aortic arch
	* leads to upper extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypotension 
	* leads to development of collateral circulation including in the rib
		* causes compression and notching of bone surface 
* associated with bicuspid aortic valve
