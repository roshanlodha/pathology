# Endocarditis
* infalmmation of the endocardium that lines the surface of valves
* usually due to a bacterial infection 
* clinical features:
	* fever (bacteremia)
	* murmur (vegitations on valve disrupt the flow across valves)
	* septic emboli (vegitations are shot off as valves flap)
		* Janeway lesions (erythematus, non-tender lesions on palms and soles)
		* Osler nodes (painful lesions on fingers and toes)
			* splinter hemorrhages
		* Anemia of chronic disease
* laboratory findings:
	 * (generally) positive blood culture
	 * (generally microcytic) anemia of chronic disease 
	 * trans-esophagial echo can detect lesions on the valve
### Strep Viridans
* most common overall cause of endocarditis
* low-virulence organism that infects previously damaged valves only 
	* damaged endocardial surfaces fevelops thrombotic vegetations due to platelets and fibrin
	* transient bacteremia (i.e. during dental procedures) leads to trapping of vacteria in the vegetations 
		* profalaxis of antibiotics before procudures can prevent
* results in small vegitations that do not destroy the valve 
### Staph aureus
* most common cause in IV drug-abusers
* high-virulence organism that infects normal valves
	* shooting up through the contaminated skin leads to tricuspid infection 
* results in large vegitations that destroy the valve
### Staph epidermidis
* causes endocarditis of prosthetic valves
### Strep bovis 
* causes endocarditis in patients with colorectal carcinoma
### HACEK organisms
* endocarditis with **negative blood cultures** includes:
	* Hemophilus
	* Actinobacillus
	* Cardiobacterium
	* Eikenella
	* Kingella 
## Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis
* sterile vegitations that arise with hypercoagulable state of underlying adenocarcinoma 
* vegitations arise on mitral valve along the lines of closure and result in regurgitation 
### Libman-Sacks Endocarditis
* sterile vegetations associated with SLE
* vegetations present on both sides of the **mitral** valve leading to mitral regurg
