# Ischemic Heart Disease
* a group of syndromes related to myocardial ischemia
* usually due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries (decreased blood flow)
## Stable Angina
* chest pain occurs with exersion or emotional stress 
* due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries with > 70% stenosis
* injury to myocytes is *reversible* and is characterized by cellular swelling
* presentation:
	* chest pain for less that 20 minutes radiates to left arm or jaw
	* diaphoresis
	* shortness of breath
	* **ST segment depression**
		* (sub)endocardial damage is characteristic of ST-segment depression
* relieved by nitroglycerin
## Unstable Angina
* chest pain that occurs at rest due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque and **incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery**
* injury to myocytes is reversible
* presentation:
	* **ST-segment depression**
* relieved by nitroglycerin
* has a risk of progression into MI as the thrombosis progresses to complete occlusion
## Prizmental Angina 
* vasospasm of the coronary artery leads to complete occlusion 
* leads to episodic chest pain unrelated to exertion
* injury to myocytes is reversible 
* presentation:
	* complete occlusion leads to transmural ischemia, causing **ST-segment elevation**
* treatment:
	* calcium channel blockers improves the vasospasm 
	* nitroglycerin 
## Myocardial Infarction
* necrosis of cardiac myocytes 
* most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and **complete** occlusion 
* other causes include:
	* coronary artery vasospasm (from **prizmental angina**)
	* emboli 
	* vasculitis (**Kawasaki disease**)
		* thrombus develops due to exposed endothelium from underlying vasculitis
* presentation:
	* severe, crushing chest pain for > 20 minutes that radiates to the left arm or jaw
	* diaphoresis
	* dyspnea (secondary to pulmonary congestion and resulting edema)
	* usually involves the RV (LV and artia are spared) due to most common arteries involved
		* LAD feeds anterior LV and anterior IV septum
		* RCA feeds posterior LV and posterior IV septum
		* LCX feeds lateral LV 
* symptoms not relieved by NG
* progression:
	1. subendocardial necrosis (< 50% of cardiac issue) 
	2. transmural infarction 
* lab testing:
	* troponin I for general infarction
	* CK-MB for reinfarction 
* treatment:
	1. ASA/heparin
	2. supplemental O2
	3. nitrates
	4. beta-blockers
	5. ACE inhibitors 
	6. fibrinolysis or angioplasty
		* leads to contraction band necrosis due to return of Ca2+ leads to contraction 
		* leads to reperfusion injury due to return of O2 leading to free radicals
* cellular changes:

# Congestive Heart Failure
## Left-sided Failure
* causes:
	1. ischemia
	2. hypertension (concentric LV hypertrophy)
	3. dilated cardiomyopathy (decreased contraction)
	4. myocardial infarction
	5. restrictive cardiomyopathy (filling is reduces)
* clinical presentation:
	* pulmonary edema with dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, and crackles
	* pulmonary "heart-failure cells" 
		* due to macrophages of alveolar air sacks consuming iron from RBCs from ruptured vessels
		* aka hemosidren-laden macrophages 
	* decreased forward perfusion leads to activation of RAAS system which exasterbates CHF
		* treatment is ACE inhibitor due to this positive feedback loop
## Right-sided Failure 
* causes:
	* mostly caused by left-heart failure which backs up into the pulmonary curcuit and eventually the RV
	* L-to-R shunts
	* chronic lung disease (cor pulmonale)
* clinical presentation:
	* JVD (feeds right heart)
	* hepatosplenomegaly (portal system feeds right heart) with cirrhosis 
	* dependent pitting edema
