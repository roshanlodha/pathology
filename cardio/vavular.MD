# Vavular Disorders
* valves prevent backflow of blood
* disorders of valves are either stenotic (slows regular flow) or regurge (allows backflow)
## Acute Rheumatic Fever
* systemic complication of pharyngitis due to A beta-hemolytic streptococci 
* affects children 2-3 weeks after strep throat 
* caused by a generated response against bacterial M protein (which mimics human tissue)
* diagnosis is made by:
	* JONES criteria:
		* J: joint problems 
		* O: heart problems (endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis)
		* N: nodules in skin
		* E: erythema marginatum (rash that is red at the margins)
		* S: systemic chorea
	* evidence of a prior group A beta-hemolytic strep infection (ASO or anti-DNase B titer)
	* minor criteria (fever or elevated ESR)
	* major criteria 
* acute attack resolves but may progress to chronic disease 
* repeat exposure to group A beta-hemolytic strep results in relapse leading to **chronic rheumatic valvular disease**
### Endocarditis
* vegitations on the endocardium, particularly in the mitral valve (maybe aortic too)
	* leads to mitral valve regurgitation
### Myocarditis 
* most common cause of death in the acute phase
* histology will show aschraf bodies with enichcal cells 
### Pericarditis
* leads to friction rub
## Chronic Rheumatic Vavlular Disease
* results in stenosis from several acute rheumatic attacks
* chordae tendinaea of mitral valve (and somtimes aortic valve) will thicken
	* in aortic valve, it will lead to fusion of commissures
## Aortic Stenosis
* narrowing of aortic valve (becomes less than 1 cm)
* usually due to fibrosis and calcification from "wear and tear" over age
* presents in late adulthood
* bicuspid aortic valve increases risk and hastens onset of aortic stenosis 
* may also arise from chronic rheumatic valve disease
* complications:
	* concentric left ventricular hypertrophy
	* angina and syncope with exercise
	* microangiopathic hemolytic anemaia 
* treatment:
	* valve replacement
## Aortic Regurgitation 
* backflow of blood from aorta into LV during diastole
* most commonly arises due to isolated aortic root dilation or valve damage
* early, blowing diastolic murmur 
	* blood will go back during diastole 
	* hyperdynamic circulation
* LV dilation and eccentric (one aspect of the ventricle) hypertrophy 
# Mirtal Valve Prolapse
* balooning of the mitral valve into the left atrium 
* mitral valve becomes floppy and bloons when opening backwards (leading to a "click")
* complications:
	* infectious endocarditis 
	* arrhythmia
	* severe mitral regurgitation
* treatment:
	* valve replacement
# Mitral Regurgitation
* reflux of blood from the LV to the LA during systole
* complication of MVP
* can be caused by LV dilation, infectious endocarditis, acute rheumatic heart disease, and papillary muscle rupture after MI
* presentation:
	* holosystolic "blowing" murmur during systole
	* louder with squatting and expiration 
	* results in volume overload and left-sided HF
## Mitral Stenosis
* narrowing of mitral valve orifice
* usually due to chronic theumatic valve disease
* open snap followed by a diastolic rumble 
* complications:
	* volume overload leads to dilatation of the LA
	* pulmonary congestion (HF cells)
	* pulmonary hypertension
	* a fib
