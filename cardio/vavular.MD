# Vavular Disorders
* valves prevent backflow of blood
* disorders of valves are either stenotic (slows regular flow) or regurge (allows backflow)
## Acute Rheumatic Fever
* systemic complication of pharyngitis due to A beta-hemolytic streptococci 
* affects children 2-3 weeks after strep throat 
* caused by a generated response against bacterial M protein (which mimics human tissue)
* diagnosis is made by:
	* JONES criteria:
		* J: joint problems 
		* O: heart problems (endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis)
		* N: nodules in skin
		* E: erythema marginatum (rash that is red at the margins)
		* S: systemic chorea
	* evidence of a prior group A beta-hemolytic strep infection (ASO or anti-DNase B titer)
	* minor criteria (fever or elevated ESR)
	* major criteria 
* acute attack resolves but may progress to chronic disease 
* repeat exposure to group A beta-hemolytic strep results in relapse leading to **chronic rheumatic valvular disease**
### Endocarditis
* vegitations on the endocardium, particularly in the mitral valve (maybe aortic too)
	* leads to mitral valve regurgitation
### Myocarditis 
* most common cause of death in the acute phase
* histology will show aschraf bodies with enichcal cells 
### Pericarditis
* leads to friction rub
## Chronic Rheumatic Vavlular Disease
* results in stenosis from several acute rheumatic attacks
* chordae tendinaea of mitral valve (and somtimes aortic valve) will thicken
	* in aortic valve, it will lead to fusion of commissures
