# Cardiomyopathy
* myocardial disease resulting in cardiac dysfunction 
## Dilated Cardiomyopathy
* dilation of all four chambers of the heart
* most common form of cardiomyopathy
* results in systolic dysfunction leading to biventricular CHF
	* complications include mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation (due to stretching) and arrhythmia 
* most commonly **idiopathic** but other causes include
	* genetic mutations (autosomal dominant)
	* myocarditis (most commonly caused by Cox virus)
	* alcohol abuse
	* drugs
	* pregnancy 
* treatment is heart transplant 
## Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
* massiv hypertrophy of the LV
* due to genetic mutations in sarcomere proteins (most commonly autosomal dominant)
* clinical features:
	* decreased cardiac output (tight heart can't squeeze as well)
	* sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias
	* syncope with exercise
		* similar to aortic stenosis
	* biopsy reveals myofiber hypertrophy with **disarray**
## Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
* decreased compliance of ventricular endomyocardium leading to decreased filling 
* restricts filling during **diastole**
* causes include:
	* amyloidosis (amyloid filling the heart wall)
	* sarcoidosis (granulomas filling the heart wall)
	* hemochromatosis (iron filling the heart wall)
	* endocardial fibroelastosis (fibrin tissue in the heart)
	* Loeffler syndrome (eisoinic infilitrate in heart wall) 
* clinical features:
	* presents with CHF due to reduced filling leading to blood back-up 
	* low voltage EKG with diminished QRS amplitudes 
# Cardiac Tumors
## Myxoma
* benign mesenchymal proliferation with a gelatinous appearance (due to abundant ground substance)
* most common primary cardiac tumor in adults 
* grows as a pedunculated mass in the LA 
* causes syncope due to mitral valve obstruction 
## Rhabdomyoma
* benign hamartoma of cardiac muscle
* most common primary cardiac tumor in children
* associated with tuberous sclerosis
* usually arises in a ventricle (more rapidly dividing)
## Metastasis
* more common than primary tumors 
* most commonly from breast, lung, melanoma, and lymphoma
* most commonly involves pericardium
	* causes a pericardial effusion
