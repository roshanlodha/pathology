# Developmental Anomalies
* failure of closure of the neural tube leads to a neural tube defect
	* arises from an incomplete closure of the neural tube
	* associated with **low folate** levels prior to conception
	* detected during prenatal care via **AFP** in amniotic fluid and maternal blood
## Anencephaly
* failure of the crainial aspect of the neural tube to close
* characterized by an absense of skull and brian 
	* leads to "frog-like" appearance of the fetus 
* results in maternal **polyhydramnios**
	* amniotic fluid is mostly baby's urine, which the baby swallows to reabsorb it
	* absence of CNS controlled swallowing centers leads to increased amniotic fluid 
## Spina Bifida
* failure of the caudal aspect (posterior vertebral arch) of the neural tube to close
* spina bifida occulta leads to a dimple or path of hair overlying the vertebral defect 
* spina bifida leads to meningocele or menignomyeleocele 
	* meningocele - meninges coming out of the spot
	* menignomyeleocele - meninges and spinal chord coming out of the spot 
## Cerebral Aqueduct Stenosis
* congenital stenosis of the channel that drains CSF from the 3rd to 4th ventricles
	* choroid plexus makes the CSF
	* then flows from the lateral to 3rd ventricle via the Foreman of Monroe
	* then flows from the 3rd to 4th ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct
* presents with englarging head circumfrence
## Dandy-Walker Malformation
* congenital failure to develop the cerebellar vermis
* presents with massively dialted 4th ventricle and no cerebellum often leading to hydrocephalus 
## Arnold-Chiari Malformation
* congenital extension of cerebellar tonsils through foramen magnum
* obstruction of CSF outflow leads to hydrocephalus
* may occur in meningomyelocele and syringomyelia 
### Type 1
* asymptomatic
### Type 2
* obstruction of the CSF flow
