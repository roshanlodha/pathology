# Truama 
## Epidural Hematoma
* epi == top; dural == dura; hemotoma == collection of blood
* collection of blood between the dura and the skull due to fracture of temporal bone and rupture of the middle meningeal artery
	* dura is tightly attached to the skull, so only a fracture can really cause this 
	* leads to a lens shape lesion until the hemotoma starts to expand due to rupture leads to herniation
		* called "talk-and-die" syndrome because patients can be totally fine, then the hematoma expands and demolishes them  
## Subdural Hematoma
* collection of blood underneath the dura (usually in the arachnoid granulations)
* usually due to rupture of a bridging vein (not a lot of pressure is needed to rip through the arachnoid)
* usually arises with truama
* presents with:
	* progressive neurological signs as the blood slowly builds up
	* herniation is a lethal complication 
		* herniation is displacement of brain tissue
### Hernations
1. tonsilar herniation: hernation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foreman magnum
	* leads to compression of the brainstem 
2. subfalicine herniation: cingulate gyrus hernaties under the falk cerebri
	* leads to compression of the anterior cerebral artery, leading to infarction
3. uncal herniation: herniation of the uncus of the temporal lobe into the area between the cerebellum
	* compression of CN III --> eyes moving down and out with a dilated pupil 
	* compression of posterior cerebral artery --> infarction of the occipital lobe 
	* pull on the paramedian artery (runs along the brainstem) --> hemorrhage on the brainstem 
# Demylelinating Disorders
* olidodendrocytes (CNS) and schwann cell (PNS) are the key cells that myleinate 
* destruction of either the myelin or the oligodendrocyte leads to preserved axons but impaired impluse conduction 
## Leukodystrophies
* leuko == white (due to myelin) :: problem with the white matter of the brain
### Metachromatic Leukodystrophy
* deficiency of arylsulfatase
	* degradation of myelin is impaired, and it accumulates in lysosomes 
* most common leukodystrophy
### Krabbe Disease
* deficiency of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase
	* galactocerebroside accumulates in macrophages 
### Adrenoleukodystrophy
* imparied addition of CoA to long-chain fatyty acids
	* leads to fatty acid accumulation which can damage the adrenal gland and white matter
### Multiple Sclerosis
* autoimmune disorder of CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes
* associated with HLA-DR2
* more common away from equator 
* clinical features:
	* blurred vision in one eye (optic)
	* vertigo and scanning, drunk-like speech (brainstem)
	* internuclear ophtalmoplesia (medial-longitudinal fasticulus)
		* the MLF controls coordination of gaze
		* damage to the MLF means that firing one eye to look in one direction will not change the direction of the other eye
	* hemiparesis or unilateral loss of sensation (cerebral white matter) 
	* lower extremity loss of sensation of weakness (spinal chord)
	* bowerl, bladder, sexual dysfunction (autonomic nervous system)
* diagnosis:
	* MRI with plaques
	* lumbar puncture shows increased lymphocytes, increased **Ig with oligoclonal IgG bands**, and **myelin basic protein**
* treatment:
	* high dose steroids in an acute attack
	* interferon-beta slows progression of disease
### Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis
* pan == both grey and white matter; encephalitis == inflammation of the brain
* progressive, debilitating encephalitis leading to death due to slowly progressing, persistent infection due to measles virus
* infection occurs in infancy but signs arise a lot later
### Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
* infection affecting white matter at multiple loci due to JC viral infection of oligodendrocytes
* latent virus exists -- immunosuppression leads to reactivation of latent virus
* presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs that lead to death
### Central Pontine Myelinolysis
* central == center; pontine == pons 
* focal demyelination of the pons 
* due to rapid IV correction of hyponatremia (occurs in alcoholics, patients with liver disease, or malnourished patients)
* called "locked-in" syndrome
	* only thing the patient can move is the eyes
