# Dementia and Degenerative Disorders
* characterizded by a loss of neurons within the gray matter
	* degeneration of gray matter in the cortex leads to dementia
	* degeneration of brainstem or **basal ganglia** gray matter in movement problems
* disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in several dementia conditions
## Alzheimer Disease
* degenerative disease of the cortex that is the most common cause of dementia
* amyloid precursor protein creates a receptor on neurons 
	* normally broken down by an alpha-secretase
	* when broken down by a beta-secretase, cannot be turned over
		* desposits as a A-beta-amyloid causing Alz
* clinical features:
	* dimentia: memory loss + cognitive dysfunction without loss of conciousness
	* slow-onset memory loss 
		* begins with recent memory progressing to distant memories
	* progressive disorientation
	* loss of learned motor skills and language 
	* behavior and personality changes 
	* patients can become mute and bedridden
	* no focal neurological deficits seen
		* distinguishes this from:
			* Parkinson's (pill rolling tremor, expressionless face)
			* Huntington's 
* epidemiology:
	1. sporadic 
		* major risk factor is age 
		* risk is increased with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE
			* increased the conversion of APP to the beta form 
		* risk is decreased with the epsilon2 allele of ApoB
	2. early onset form
		* familial form (presenilin 1 or 2)
		* patients with Down Syndrome
			* APP is found on chromosome 21
* classic pathologic features:
	* **diffuse** cerebral atrophy
		* narrowing of the gyri
		* widening of the sulci
		* **hydrocephalus ex vacuo** due to atrophy
	* noridic plaque development
		* has A-beta-alymoid (amyloid is always extracellular) 
			* traps noridic processes 
			* can deposit on blood vessels around the brain, called cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
				* weakens the blood vessel to increase the risk of hemorrhage
	* formation of neurofiulary tangles 
		* deposition of neurofibulary tangle (NFT) in the cytoplasm of neurons make them long-boys
			* NFT is a Tau protein that becomes hyper-phosphorylated in pathology 
* diagnosis:
	* diagnosis of exclusion confirmed via pathology at autopsy 
## Vascular Dementia
* decreased bloodflow to the brain leads to multifocal infarction and injury
* can be due to HTN, atherosclerosis, or vasculitis
* 2nd most common cause of dementia
	* can be treated by treating the underlying vascular disease
* recall from **moderate global ischemia**:
	* leads to selective destruction of gray matter in layers 3, 5, and 6 (pyramidal neurons) and the hippocampus
## Pick Disease
* degenerative disease of the cortex -- specifically the frontal and temporal cortex with sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes
* frontal cortex leads to behavior problems
* temporal cortex leads to language problems
* has characteristic **round** aggregates of Tau protein in neurons of the cortex 
	* **Alz** produces **NFTs**
## Parkinson Disease
* degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia 
* cortex communicates with the basal ganglia which sends input back into the cortex 
	* key processing center of BG is the striatum which sends either stimulatory or inhibitory input to the cortex
	* SNpc also sends input to the BG via dopamine
		* binding of D1 receptors leads to stimulation while D2 leads to inhibition
* unknown etiology with age as a risk factor
	* exposure to MPTP is also a risk factor
* clinical features:
	* **T**remor
	* **R**igidity
	* **A**kinesia or bradykinesia
	* **P**ostural instability and shuffling gait 
* will present with Lewy bodies (composed of alpha-synuclein) on histology 
* dementia is a common feature of late Parkinson's
	* early-onset dimentia suggests a different disorder: **Lewy body dementia**
		* characterized by dementia, hallucination, and parkinsonian features with **cortical** Lewy bodies
			* instead of deep brain Lewy bodies
* no parkinsonian tremors are often the result of medication uptiters, including SSRIs
## Huntington's Disease
* loss of the GABAergic neurons of the **caudate nucleus** of the basal ganglia
	* loss of caudate nuclear leads to opening up of the lateral ventricle (hydrocephalus ex vacuo)
* cortex communicates with the basal ganglia which sends input back into the cortex 
	* striatum is composed of the caudate and the putament
		* caudate nucleus is the gray matter structure pushes against the lateral ventricle 
		* seperated from putamen through the striatum 
	* GABA prevents sudden jittery movement as it is inhibitory
		* leads to choria, or random firing of muscles
* autosomal dominant disorder due to an expanded trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in huntington gene 
	* can be "anticipated" or progressively early onset of the disease
		* this is due to further expansion of the trinucleotide repeat which occurs during spermatogenesis 
* clinical features:
	* chorea
	* athetosis: slow, involuntary, snake-like movement of the fingers 
	* progression to dementia and depression 
		* suicide is a common cause of death
## Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus
* common cause of idiopathic dementia in adults
* increased CSF leads to dilated ventricles, leading to stretching of the **corona radiata**
	* occurs due to idiopathic decreased absorption of CSF into the arachnoid granulations and thus the dural venus sinus 
	* lumbar puncture releases the pressure, improving the symptoms
	* treatment is a VP shunt 
* presents with triad of:
	1. wet: urinary incontinence
	2. wacky: dementia
	3. wobbly: gait instability
## Spongiform Encephalopathy
* degenerative disease due to prion protein accumulation
* normal PrPc is in the alpha-helical form 
	* conversion to PrPsc (beta-sheet form) produces pathological protein via two mechanisms:
		1. induces production of PrPsc 
		2. accumulates in the neurons and cannot be degraded leading to damage to neurons 
			* classic damage produces spongey holes in gray matter 
* pathophysiology can be:
	* sporadic: sporadic conversion of alpha to beta form 
	* inherited: increased production of beta form 
	* transmitted: exposure to beta form increases production of beta form 
### Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
* most common form of spongiform encephalopathy
* usually sporadic but can be transmitted (e.g. in transplant)
* clinical features:
	* rapid dementia 
	* death in < 1 year
	* ataxia due to cerebellar involvement
	* startle myoclonus: involuntary contraction of muscle with minimal stimuli
	* spike-wave complexes on EEG 
### Variant CJD
* called "mad cow" disease as it is a result of consumption of bad meat from a cow 
### Familial Fatal Insomnia
* characterized by insomnia and an exaggerated startle response
