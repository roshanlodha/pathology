# CNS Tumors
* about half metastatic and half primary
* metastatic tumors present as multiple, well-circumscribed lesions at the gray-white junctions 
	* mostly from lung cancer, breast cancer, and kidney cancer
## Primary Tumors
* classified according to cell type 
* malignant primary tumors are locally destructive but rarely metastasize
* CNS is 50% neurons and 50% glial tissue surrounded by meningomyelocells
	* glial tissue includes:
		* astrocytes (form the BBB)
		* Oligodendrocytes (myelinate the axons)
		* epyendymal cells (line ventricular spaces) 
| Cell Type         | Children              | Adults                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Astrocytes        | Pilocytic Astrocytoma | Glioblastoma Multiforme |
| Oligodendrocytes  | N/A                   | Oligodendroglioma       |
| Ependymal         | Ependymoma            | N/A                     |
| Neurons           | Meduloblastoma        | N/A                     |
| Meningomyelocells | N/A                   | Meningioma              |

* tumors in adults occur above the tentorium while tumors in kids occur below the tentorium 
### Glioblastoma Multiforme
* malignant, high-grade tumor of astrocytes
* most common malignant CNS tumor in adults 
* crosses corpus collosum, giving a butterfly appearance
* on histology:
	* produces large necrotic region
	* living cells produce an edge around necrosis (psuedopalisading tumor)
	* endothelial cell proliferation 
* derived from glial cells, leading to marking via GFAP
### Meningioma
* benign tumor of the arachnoid cells 
* most common bening tumor of adults, more common in females
	* tumor expresses estrogen receptor 
* imaging reveals that the tumor forms around a round mass attached to the dura 
	* pressing (not invasion) on the cortex leads to seizures
* on histology:
	* swirl appearance 
	* produces psomoma bodies due to calcification of swirled cells 
### Schwannoma 
* benign tumor of schwann cells (which mylenate the PNS)
* involves the cranial or spinal nerves, especially the 8th cranial nerve at the cerelopontaine angle 
	* clasically leads to loss of hearing or tinnitus 
* S100 positive 
* bilateral schwannomas are seen in neurofibromitosis type 2 (NF2)
### Oligodendroglioma
* malignant tumors of oligodendrocytes
* calcified tumor in the white matter usually in the frontal lobe 
* may present with seizures
* on histology:
	* "fried egg" appearance 
### Pediatric Neuro-oncology
#### Pilocytic Astrocytoma
* benign tumor of astrocytes 
* most common CNS tumor in children in the cerebellum
* on imaging:
	* cystic lesion with a nodule growing on the wall 
* on histology:
	* astrocytes with thick eosinic cytoplasm (Rosenthal fibers) 
	* GFAP positive as astrocytes are glial cells 
#### Medulloblastoma
* malignant tumor derived from granular cells of cerebellum (derived from neuroectoderm)
* usually arises in children
* on histology:
	* presents with small, round blue cells
	* Homer-Wright rosettes
		* when the round blue cells wrap around pink neuritic processes 
* poor prognosis as the tumor grows rapidly and spreads via the CSF where it can spread to the spinal chord (drop metastasis)
#### Ependymoma
* malignant tumor of ependymal cells (line ventricular space and produce CSF) 
* most commonly in children --> beneath the tentorium --> arises in 4th ventricle --> may present with hydrocephalus 
* on histology:
	* perivascular psuedorosettes 
#### Craniopharyngioma
* cranio == in brain; pharyng == from pharygi; oma == tumor 
* tumor that arises from epithelial remnants of Rathke's pouch
	* upward protrussion of the base of the brain leads to formation of the anterior pituitary
		* this is called Rathke's pouch 
		* eventually should pinch off but sometimes remnants can remain
	* downward protrussion of the base of the brain leads to formation of the posterior pituitary
	* these structures join eventually to form the pituitary 
* presents as a supertentorial mass in a child or young adult 
* can compress the optic chiasm leading to bitemporal hemianopsia (usually associated with pituitary tumors)
* on imaging:
	* calcified (derived from floor of the mouth which has tooth-like tissue)
* benign but will recur after resection
