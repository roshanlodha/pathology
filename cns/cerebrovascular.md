# Cerebrovascular Disease
* neurological deficit due to cerebrovascular compromise 
* due to ischemia (85% - focal or global) or hemorrhage (15% - sub-arachnoid or intracerebral)
## Global Cerebral Ischemia 
* can occur due to:
	1. low perfusion (atherosclerosis)
	2. acute decrease in blood flow (shock)
	3. chronic hypoxia (anemia)
	4. repeated episodes of hypoglycemia (insulinoma)
### Mild Global Ischemia
* transient with a complete recovery (such as in an insulinoma)
	* blood sugar goes down
	* complete recovery with gluc 
### Severe Global Ischemia
* diffuse necrosis with likely death or vegetative state
### Moderate Global Ischemia
* infarcts in watersshed (very end of a vessel) areas
* damage to highly vulnerable regions 
	* pyramidal neurons 
		* creates **cortical laminar necrosis** in lines 3, 5, 6
	* hippocampus
		* transfers information to long term memory
	* purkinje layer of cerrebelum
		* cerrebellar signs including ataxia
## Ischemic Strokes
* focal ischemia < 24 hrs is considered transient while focal ischemia > 24 hrs is considered ischemic stroke
	* ischemic stroke is regional ischemia that results in focal neurologic deficits for > 24 hrs
* can develop 3 ways: 
	1. thrombotic stoke 
		* arises due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (usually at branch points)
		* results of a pale infarct at the periphery of cortex 
	2. embolic stroke 
		* due to thromboembolus (most commonly on the left side of the heart from a-fib event)
		* usually involves the middle cerebral artery
		* results in hemorrhagic infarct
	3.  lacunar stroke
		* involves the small blood vessels of the brain secondary to hyaline arteriolosclerosis
			* hyaline arteriosclerosis is due to thickening of the wall of small blood vessels in the brain
			* can occur due to benign hypertension or diabetes
		* classically involves the deep structures of the brain and the lenticulostriate vessels
			 * these vessels are branches of the middle cerebral artery 
* ischemic stroke leads to liquefactive necrosis of the brain
	1. early finding is red neurons (12 hrs)
	2. neutrophils, microglical cells (macrophages) and granulation tissue come in (1 day - 1 week)
	3. results in fluid-filled cystic space with surrounding gliosis (astrocytes that line the cystic space) (1 week +)
## Intracerebral Hemorrhage 
* bleeding into the brain parenchyma 
* classically due to rupture of **Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms**
* occurs due to hypertension
* basal ganglia is the most common site due to the lenticulostriate vessels
## Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
* bleeding into the subarachnoid space (classically on the bottom of the brain) most commonly due to berry aneurysms
	* berry aneurysms are thin-walled saccular outpouching that **lack a media layer** due to branch of the artery 
	* most frequently located in the antior circle of Willis where it branches into the anterior communicating artery 
	* associated with Marfan and AD PKD (Autosomal Dominant Posycystic Kidney Disease)
* presents with sudden headache ("the worst headache of my life") with nuchal rigidity
* LP shows xanthochromia (yellow tinge to the CSF due to bilirubin)
* treatment:
	* oral **nimodipine** should be given after subarachnoid hemorrhage to prevent vasospasm and ischemic stroke
