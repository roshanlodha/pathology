# Meningitis
* inflammation of the leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia)
	* brain structure:
		1. skull 
		2. dura (thick and durable)
		3. arachnoid (light and thin -- leptomeninges)
		4. pia (light and thin -- leptomeninges)
		5. brain 
* most commonly due to infectious agent
	* neonates: GBS, E. Coli, L. monocytogenes
		* GBS and E. Coli can come from the mother's vaginal canal
			* women in the third semester are tested and treated for GBS
	* children and teenagers: N. meningitidis from the nasopharynx
		* travels from blood to meninges
	* adults and elderly: Strep pneumo 
	* nonvaccinated infants: H flu
	* viral: Coxsackievirus (fecal-oral)
	* immunocompromised: Fungi
* classic triad: headache, neck stiffness, and fever
	* headache and neck stifness come from mechanical compression of brain 
	* fever due to infection
* photophobia (viral), vomitting, altered mental status
* diagnosed with lumbar puncture between L4/L5 or the iliac crest (spinal chord ends at L2 but sub-arachnoid space does not and will not pierce the chord)
	* an LP goes through the skin, ligaments, epidural space, dura, then arachnoid but not the pia 
	* bacterial - neutrophils with low glucose and positive gram stain and culture
		* Strep Pneumo is the most common cause of meningitis in all ages
			* lancet-shaped, gram positive cocci in pairs 
			* can follow a strep respiratory infection
			* increased risk in aspleinc, sickle cell, and alcoholics
			* also causes otitis media in kinda, pneumonia, and sinusitis
		* Neisseria Meningitidis is a gram neg cocci in pairs
			* transmitted through respiratory dropules
			* enters pharynx then bloodstream then CSF
			* many carry it asymptomatically
			* polysaccharide capsule prevents phagocytosis
			* LOS outer membrane 
				* like LPS and creates endotoxin that active inflammatory response
			* can cause bacteremia in addition (**meningococcemia**)
				* causes sepsis, purpuric rash, DIC, and adrenal destruction 
			* causes outbreaks 
			* prophylaxis:
				* rifampin (changes color of tear) or ciprofloxacin
		* H. Flu
			* small, gram neg rod
			* enters pharynx, lymphatics, then CSF 
			* most common in the anti-vax or immigrant population 
		* Listeria 
			* facultative, intracellular, gram pos rod 
			* multiplies in cells in the immunocompromised (neonates, HIV, organ transplant patients)
			* comes from contaminated foods
			* can occur in neonates through vaginal or transplacental transmission
		* GBS (strep agalactiae)
			* gram pos cocci in chains
				* catalase negative 
				* beta-hemolytic
				* CAMP test positive 
			* most common cause in newborns through birth canal transmission. Ampicillin during labor can prevent it
				* may not have classic symtpoms of meningitis
					* hypotonia, weak sucking reflex
					* bulging fontanels, sunken eyes
					* poor feeding
		* E. Coli is the second most common cause of meningitis in neonates 
			* motile, gram neg bacillus
			* some straings have K1 capsular antigen which inhibits complements
			* grows on:
				* blood agar (sheep blood)
				* MacConkey agar (selects for gram neg bacteria)
				* eosin methylene blue agar 
	* viral - lymphocytes with normal CSF glucose due to lack of consumption
		* usually caused by cax, echo, or polio
		* self-limited
		* supportive care
		* HSV-1 
			* causes oral herpes, eye infections, **encephalitis** (infects the temporal lobe)
		* HSV-2 
			* genital herpes (with lesions)
			* 1/3 have clinical findings of meningitis including headache, photophobia, etc. 
	* fungal - lymphocytes with low CSF glucose 
		* needs multiple CSF samples as it is hard to culture TB

* previously diagnosed with:
	* Kernig sign
	* Brudzinski sign 
	* previous diagnosis would not excluse subarachnoid hemorrhage
* complications (death from hernation, hydrocephalus, hearing loss, and seizures) are seen most commonly with bacterial meningitis
* treatment:
	* antibiotics (but culturing can take days)
	* choose a drug based on age, comorbidities, and spinal tap
		* cefriaxone
		* vancomycin
		* ampicillin
		* gentamycin 
	* examine spinal tap for:
		* cells
		* protein
		* glucose
		* culture

## Encephalitis
* inflammation of the brain
* must make sure meningitis patients do not have:
	* altered mental status
	* motor or sensory deficits
	* altered behavior and personality changes
	* speech/movement disorders
* can also be caused by:
	* varicella (chickenpox, shingles)
	* Naegleria fowleri
	* HIV
	* Lassa fever
	* Measles
	* mosquitos:
		* St. Louis encephalitis virus
		* Eastern/western equine
		* West Nile
		* CA enchephalitis
