# Spinal Chord Disorders 
## Syringomyelia
* cystic degeneration of the spinal chord 
* arises with trauma or in association with **Arnold-Chiari malformation**
* classically occurs from C8-T1 
	* degeneration of the **anterior white commisure** leads to sensory loss of pain and temperature (spinothalamic tract)
	* fine touch and position sense are spared in the upper extermities (dorsal column)
	* expanding degeneration knocks out the **anterior horn**
		* leads to lower motor neurons symptoms 
	* expanding degeneration to the **lateral lorn** and the **hypothalmospinal tract**
		* this leads to **Horner syndrome**, or ptosis, myosis, anhydrosis 
## Poliomyelitis 
* damage to the **anterior motor horn** due to poliovirus infection 
	* leads to lower motor symptoms including flaccid paralysis, decreased tone, negative babinski sign
## Werdig-Hoffmann Disease 
* inherited degeneration of the **anterior motor horn** -- essentially autosomal recessive polio
* presents with "floppy baby"
* death occurs within a few years of birth
## Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
* degenerative disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons via the **corticospinal tract**
* **anterior motor horn** involvement leads to LMN signs
* **lateral corticospinal tract** involvement leads to UMN signs
* similar to **Syringomyelia** but lacks sensory impairment 
* most cases are sporadic and arise in middle aged adults
	* Zinc-copper superoxide dismutase mutation can present in some familial cases
# Friedreich Ataxia 
* degeneration of the cerebellum and spinal chord tracts 
* presents with ataxia (due to cerebellar involvement) with loss of vibratory sense and propioception 
	* muscle weakness in lower extremities and loss of deep tendon reflexes
* autosomal recessive disorder with an unstable trinucleotide repeat (GAA) in the frataxin gene 
	* gene involved in iron free radical handling 
	* presents in early childhood with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
