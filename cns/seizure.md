# Seizures
* sudden alteration in behavior due to transient brain pathology 
	* epilepsy is multiple seizures
* symptoms include:
	* loss of conciousness
	* abnormal motor activity
	* abnormal sensation
	* range from loss of awareness (absence seizure) to tonic-clnic seizures 
* causes:
	* many people can have just a single seizure
	* often provoked:
		* fever (children)
		* lack of sleep
		* drugs, alcohol
		* hypoglycemia
	* tumor
	* stroke

* seizure workup:
	* blood workup (electrolyte imbalances can trigger seizures)
	* EKG (cardiac syncope can mimic a seizure)
	* EEG
		* records voltage in the brain
	* brain imaging
	* LP
* autonomic symptoms:
	* epigastric "rising" sensation 
	* sweating
	* piloerection
	* pupillary changes
## Partial
* a seizure that involves one discrete part of the brain
	* simple: no alteration in consciousness
	* complex partial: altered conciousness 
* often cause psychic symptoms
	* affects the higher cortical areas
	* dysphasia (trouble speaking)
	* deja vu
	* time distortion
	* fear
	* hallucinations 
* auras often precede major seizures but are actually simple, partial seizures
	* causes symptoms but do not interfere with conciousness
	* symptoms depend on the area of the brain 
* most common site is the temporal lobe
	* results from mesial temporal (hippocampal) sclerosis, or neuronal loss in the hippocampus
	* bilateral with one side > the other
	* diagnosed with MRI
## Generalized
* effects the entire brain
	* absence (Petit mal) seizure
		* common in children
	* tonic-clonic (Grand mal) seizure
	* atonic (Drop) seizure
		* patient becomes flaccid and collapses
	* myotonic 
		* rhythmic jerking of the body
* secondary generalized seizures start as a partial seizure then generalize 
## Post-ictal State
* transition period from the seizure to the normal state when the brain recovers 
* patient will remain confused and have a lack of awareness 
* focal neurological defiicts may be present 
## Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy
* most common cause of seizures in children
* can cause absence, myoclonic, and grand mal seizures
* progression:
	1. absense seizures (~5 years old)
	2. myoclonic seizures later (~15 years old)
	3. Grand mal seizures right after
* hallmarks are myoclonic jerks on awakening from sleep and a shock-like, irregular movement of both arms 
## Childhood Absence Epilepsy
* sudden impairment of consciousness, as if the child is not paying attention
* no change in body/motor tone that last a few seconds 
* usually remits by puberyu
* has a classic EEG finging of 2.5-5 Hz spike wave activity superimposed on a normal background EEG
* no post-ictal confusion
* ethosuximide is the first line treatment
	* MOA: blocks thalamic T-type Ca++ channels 
## Febrile Seizures
* common in children (2-4% of children < 5 years old have febrile seizures)
	* most outgrow these seizures
* child loses conciousness and shakes 
## Eclampsia
* pregnancy relation condition
* preeclampsia == HTN, proteinuriam edema 
* eclampsia == preeclampsia + seizures
* treated with MgSO4
## Antiseizure Drugs 
* treatment targets two pathways:
	* breaking an active seizure such as in status epilepticus
		* continuous seizure > 30 minutes or multiple seizures that recur before 30 minutes
		* considered a medical emergency as it can cause:
			* arrhythmia
			* lactic acidosis
			* HTN
	* preventing future seizures
* all antiepileptics are teratogenic
* valproic acid has a 1-3% chance of causing neural tube defects
### Breaking Seizures
1. benzodiazapines 
	* typically lorazapam (rapid acting)
	* always treats status epilepticus
2. Phenytoin of Fosphenytoin 
3. Phenobarbital
4. General anesthesia + intubation 
### Preventing Seizures
#### Na Inactivators
1. phenytoin
	* inactivates Na channels 
	* very useful for clonic-tonic seizures
	* adverse affects:
		* gingival hyperplasia, hair growth 
		* rash 
		* folic acid depletion
		* decreased bone density
		* nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia 
	* dose-dependent hepatic metabolism
		* low-dose leads to small increase in drug blood levels
		* high-dose leads to rapid increase in drug blood levels
2. carbamazepine
	* inactivates Na channels
	* useful for partial and generalized seizures
	* also treats bipolar disorder and trigeminal neuralgia 
	* tons of side effects, including (drug levels must be monitored):
		* diplopia (blurry vision)
		* ataxia
		* low blood counts (must monitor CBC):
			* agranulocytosis
			* aplastic anemia 
			* bone marrow supression:
				* low platlets
		* liver toxicity (must monitor LFTs)
		* SIADH (causes low Na level)
		* SJS 
3. lamotrigine
4. valproic acid
#### GABA Activators
1. phenobarbital
	* barbituate
	* binds the GABA receptor but unlike benzos it increases the duration the channel is open 
	* increases Cl- influx preventing firing 
	* adverse affects:
		* myocardial/respiratory depression (as with all barbs)
		* CNS depression when mixed with EtOH
		* contraindicated in **porphyria**
		* P450 inducer 
			* causes drugs metabolized by P450 to decrease in concentration
			* less bad than a P450 inhibitor like Warfarin
2. tiagabine
3. bigabatrin
4. valproic acid
	* Na and GABA effects
	* increased synthesis and decreased breakdown of GABA 
	* mood stabilizer
	* adverse affects:
		* tremors
		* weight gain
		* hepatotoxic
		* GI symptoms 
#### Others
1. gabapentine
	* affects Ca channels
	* causes sedation and ataxia
2. topiramate
	* Na and GABA effects
	* mental dulling sedation
	* weight loss
	* kidney stones 
3. ethosuximide
	* always used for absence seizures
	* blocks thalamic T-type Ca++ channels 
	* cause
4. levetiracetam
	* very very very effective and has displaced many drugs 
5. primidone 
	* unknown mechanism
	* becomes phenobarbital
