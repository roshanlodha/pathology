# Spinal Chord Disorders 
## Syringomyelia
* cystic degeneration of the spinal chord 
* arises with trauma or in association with **Arnold-Chiari malformation**
* classically occurs from C8-T1 
	* degeneration of the **anterior white commisure** leads to sensory loss of pain and temperature (spinothalamic tract)
	* fine touch and position sense are spared in the upper extermities (dorsal column)
	* expanding degeneration knocks out the **anterior horn**
		* leads to lower motor neurons symptoms 
	* expanding degeneration to the **lateral lorn** and the **hypothalmospinal tract**
		* this leads to **Horner syndrome**, or ptosis, myosis, anhydrosis 
## Poliomyelitis 
* damage to the **anterior motor horn** due to poliovirus infection 
	* leads to lower motor symptoms including flaccid paralysis, decreased tone, negative babinski sign
## Werdig-Hoffmann Disease 
* inherited degeneration of the **anterior motor horn** -- essentially autosomal recessive polio
* presents with "floppy baby"
* death occurs within a few years of birth
## Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
