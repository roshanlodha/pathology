# Acute Inflammation
* inflammation allows inflammatory cells, plasma proteins, and fluid to exit blood vessels and enter the interstitial space
* divided into acute (neutrophils) and chronic (lymphocytes) inflammation
* acute inflammation is characterized by edema (fluid) and neutrophils 
* acute inflammation is an quick, innate response that arises in response to infection or **tissue necrosis**
	* goal is to eliminate a pathogen or **clear necrotic debris**
	* specificity is limited
* mediated by several factors, including TLRs
## Toll-Like Receptors
* toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern)
* CD14 is a TLR on macrophages that recognizes LPS **on the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria**
* TLR activation results in upregulation of NF-kB which activates
	1. immune response genes
	2. produces immune response proteins
* TLRs are also present on cells of adaptive immunity and can mediate chronic inflammation as well
## Arachadonic Acid 
* released from the phospholipid cell membrane by phospholipase A2
* acted on by COX or 5-lipooxygenase
	* COX produces prostaglandin (PGI2, PGD2, PGE2) to cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
		* PGE2 also mediates fever and pain
	* lipooxygenase produces Leukotrines (LT)
		* LTB4 attracts and activates neutrophils
			* 4 mediators for neutrophil attraction: 
				1. LTB4 
				2. C5a
				3. IL-8
				4. bacterial products
		* LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 mediate vasoconstriction, bronchospasm, and increased vascular permeability 
			* pericytes have smooth muscle, which contracts and increases the space between pericytes thus increasing vascular permeability
## Mast Cells
* widely distributed in connective tissue
* activated by:
	1. tissue truama 
	2. complement proteins C3a and C5a
	3. cross-linking of cell-surface IgE and antigen 
* immediate response:
	* release of preformed histamine gransules 
		* mediates vasodilation of arterioles
		* increased vascular permeability
* delayed response:
	* produces arachidonic acid metabolites (skew towards LT)
## Complement Proteins
* group of proinflammatory serum proteins that circulate as inactive precursors
* eventually leads to C3 convertase activation followed by C5 convertase activation followed by formation of the MAC (membrane attack complex)
	* MAC lysis the organism membrane
* key products:
	1. C3a and C5a trigger mast cell degranulationm
	2. C5a is a chemotactic for neurtophils
	3. C3b is an opsonin for phagocytosis
	4. MAC helps lyse microbes 
### Classical Pathway
* C1 binds to IgG or IgM that is bound to an antigen (GM makes classic cars)
### Alternative Pathway
* microbial products diractly activate complement
### Mannose-Binding Lectin Pathway 
* mannose binds lectin on microorganisms which leads to complement activation
## Hageman Factor
* inactive proinflammatory protein produced in liver that is activated on exposure to subendothelial or tissue collagen (damage)
* plays a key role in DIC in gram negative sepsis as the bacteria are able to activate Hageman factor 
* activates coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, complement, and kinin systems 
	* it cleaves HMWK to bradykinin
		* bradykinin mediates vasodilation, vascular permeability, and pain
## Cardinal Signs of Inflammation
* vasodilation is due to increased blood flow (rubor and calor) due to **histamine**, PG, and bradykinin
* swlling is due to leakage opf fluid from the postcapilary venule and is mediated by **histamine** and tissue damage
* pain (dolor) is due to bradykinin and PGE2 by sensitizing sensory nerve endings 
* fever is due to pyrogens (IL-1 and TNF) increasing COX activity in the perivascular cells of the hypothalamus leading to an increase in PGE2
