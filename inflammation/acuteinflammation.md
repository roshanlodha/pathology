# Acute Inflammation
* inflammation allows inflammatory cells, plasma proteins, and fluid to exit blood vessels and enter the interstitial space
* divided into acute (neutrophils) and chronic (lymphocytes) inflammation
* acute inflammation is characterized by edema (fluid) and neutrophils 
* acute inflammation is an quick, innate response that arises in response to infection or **tissue necrosis**
	* goal is to eliminate a pathogen or **clear necrotic debris**
	* specificity is limited
* mediated by several factors, including TLRs
## Toll-Like Receptors
* toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular pattern)
* CD14 is a TLR on macrophages that recognizes LPS **on the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria**
* TLR activation results in upregulation of NF-kB which activates
	1. immune response genes
	2. produces immune response proteins
* TLRs are also present on cells of adaptive immunity and can mediate chronic inflammation as well
## Arachadonic Acid 
* released from the phospholipid cell membrane by phospholipase A2
* acted on by COX or 5-lipooxygenase
	* COX produces prostaglandin (PGI2, PGD2, PGE2) to cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
		* PGE2 also mediates fever and pain
	* lipooxygenase produces Leukotrines (LT)
		* LTB4 attracts and activates neutrophils
			* 4 mediators for neutrophil attraction: 
				1. LTB4 
				2. C5a
				3. IL-8
				4. bacterial products
		* LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 mediate vasoconstriction, bronchospasm, and increased vascular permeability 
			* pericytes have smooth muscle, which contracts and increases the space between pericytes thus increasing vascular permeability
## Mast Cells
* widely distributed in connective tissue
* activated by:
	1. tissue truama 
	2. complement proteins C3a and C5a
	3. cross-linking of cell-surface IgE and antigen 
* immediate response:
	* release of preformed histamine gransules 
		* mediates vasodilation of arterioles
		* increased vascular permeability
* delayed response:
	* produces arachidonic acid metabolites (skew towards LT)
## Complement Proteins
* group of proinflammatory serum proteins that circulate as inactive precursors
* eventually leads to C3 convertase activation followed by C5 convertase activation followed by formation of the MAC (membrane attack complex)
	* MAC lysis the organism membrane
* key products:
	1. C3a and C5a trigger mast cell degranulationm
	2. C5a is a chemotactic for neurtophils
	3. C3b is an opsonin for phagocytosis
	4. MAC helps lyse microbes 
### Classical Pathway
* C1 binds to IgG or IgM that is bound to an antigen (GM makes classic cars)
### Alternative Pathway
* microbial products diractly activate complement
### Mannose-Binding Lectin Pathway 
* mannose binds lectin on microorganisms which leads to complement activation
## Hageman Factor
* inactive proinflammatory protein produced in liver that is activated on exposure to subendothelial or tissue collagen (damage)
* plays a key role in DIC in gram negative sepsis as the bacteria are able to activate Hageman factor 
* activates coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, complement, and kinin systems 
	* it cleaves HMWK to bradykinin
		* bradykinin mediates vasodilation, vascular permeability, and pain
## Cardinal Signs of Inflammation
* vasodilation is due to increased blood flow (rubor and calor) due to **histamine**, PG, and bradykinin
* swlling is due to leakage opf fluid from the postcapilary venule and is mediated by **histamine** and tissue damage
* pain (dolor) is due to bradykinin and PGE2 by sensitizing sensory nerve endings 
* fever is due to pyrogens (IL-1 and TNF) increasing COX activity in the perivascular cells of the hypothalamus leading to an increase in PGE2
## Neutrophil Arival and Function
* peaks at 24 hours; followed by macrophage phase (peaks at 2-3 days) and preceded by fluid phase (above)
1. Margination
	* vasodilation causes the cells to marginate from the center to the periphery 
2. Rolling 
	* marginated cells will hit selectins causing the cells to slow down and roll
		* P-selectin is released from WP bodies by histamine
		* E-selectin is induced by TNF and IL-1
	* selectins bind sialyl-LewisX on leukocytes 
		* this interactions results in rolling of leukocytes along the vessel wall
3. Adhesion
	* cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) are upregulated by TNF and IL-1
	* CAMs bind integrins which are upregulated on leukocytes by C5a and LTB4
		* **Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency** occurs due to a defect in the CD18 subunit of integrins leading to:
			1. delayed seperation of the umbilical cord
				* necrosis allows for seperation of the umbilical cord but it is faulty here 
			2. increased circulating neutrophils
			3. recurrent bacterial infections that lack pus
4. Transmission and Chemotaxis 
	* leukocytes transmigrate across endothelium of postcapillary venules towards chemical attractants (baterial products, IL8, C5a, LTB4)
5. Phagocytosis
	* consumption of pathogens or necrotic tissue is enhanced by opsonins (C3b, IgG)
	* psuedopods from leukocytes etend to form phagosomes
		* internalizes and merges with lysosomes
	* **Chediack-Higashi Syndrome** involves defect in protein trafficking and thus impaired phagosome formation leading to:
		1. increased risk of pyogenic infections
		2. neutropenia
		3. giant granules in leukocytes
		4. defective primary hemostasis
		5. albinism
		6. peripheral neuropathy
6. Destruction of Phagocytosed Material
	1. Oxygen-dependent mechanism
		* O2 + NADPHOx --> O2- + SOD --> H2O2 + MPO --> HOCl
		* most effective mechanism
		* **Chronic Granulomatous Disease** is a NADPH Ox defect (X-linked or autosomal recessive) leading to:
			1. chronic granulomas 
			2. recurrent infections with catalase positive organisms
				* catalase destroys H2O2, preventing an alternative pathway for bleach
				* S. Aureus, **P. cepacia**, S. marcescens, Nocardia, Aspergillus
			3. Nitroblue Tetrazolium test (turns blue in the presense of O2-)
		* **MPO Deficiency** is a MPO defect leading to an increased risk of Candida infections with a:
			1. normal NBT 
			2. most patients are asymptomatic
	2. O2-independent mechanism
		* leff effective
7. Resolution
	* neutrophils undergo apoptosis (pus) and disappear within 24 hours after resolution of inflammation
## Macrophage Arival and Function
* arrive via the same mechanism of margination, rolling, adhesion, and transmigration 
* derived from monocytes in blood
* ingest content using phagocytosis and use O2-independent mechanism to destroy materials in secondary granules 
* triage the next step of inflammation:
	* can trigger resolution and healing via IL-10 and TGF-B
	* can continue accute inflammation via IL-8
	* can creater an abcess to wall off an organism and inflammation
	* can trigger chronic inflammation
