# Chronic Inflammation
* delayed response but more specific (adaptive immunity)
* mononuclear cells are characteristic of chronic inflammation, including plasma cells and lymphocytes
* stimuli for chronic inflammation include:
	1. persistent infection
	2. infection with viruses, mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi
	3. autoimmune disease
	4. foreign material
	5. cancers 
## T Lymphocytes
* produced in the bone marrow and "go to college" in the thymus
	* undergo t-cell receptor rearrangement 
	* progenitor cells become either CD4+ (helper) or CD8+ (cytotoxic) T-cells
* TCR complex recognizes antigens on the MHC 
	* MHC II for CD4+ T-cells
	* MHC I for CD8+ T-cells 
### T-Cell Activation
1. binding of antigen and MHC complex
	* CD4+ T-cell activation occurs by extracellular antigen that is phagocytosed and presented 
	* CD8+ T-cell activation occurs by intracellular antigen that is presented on MHC I
2. 2nd signal required
	* B7 on APC binds CD28 on CD4+ T-cells
		* activated CD4+ T-cells secrete cytokines
			* Th1 subset helps CD8+ T-cells via IL-2 and INF-gamma
			* Th2 subset helps B-cells via IL-4 (class switching), IL-5 (maturation and IgA), and IL-10 (inhibits Th1)
	* IL-2 from CD4+ Th1 cells activate CD8+ T-cells
		* activated CD8+ T-cells directly kill via secretion of perforins and granzymes and expression of FasL which promotes apoptosis
## B Lymphocytes
* produced in the bone marrow and unergo Ig rearrangement to become naive B cells that express IgM and IgD
### B-cell Activation
* antigen directly binds surface IgM or IgD
* B-cell presents antigen to CD4+ T-cell via MHC II --> CD40 receptor on B-cell binds CD40L on Th for second activation signal
	* Helper T-cell secreted IL-4 and IL-5, which allows B-cell to class switch, hypermutate, and mature into a plasma cell 
## Granulomatous Inflammation
* a subtype of chronic inflammation characterized by a granuloma defined by a epitheloid histiocyte (a macrophage with pink cytoplasm)
* can be surrounded by giant cells and a rim of lymphocytes
* granulomas formation:
	1. macrophages present antigen to CD4+ Th cells 
	2. macrophages secrete IL-12, inducing Th1 differentiation
	3. Th1 secretes INF-gamma, which converts macrophages into epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells 
### Noncaseating
* noncaseating granulomas lack a central point of necrosis 
* arrise from:
	1. reaction to foreign material
	2. sarcoidosis 
	3. berryllium exposure 
	4. crohn disease
		* can be distinguished from ulcerative coloitis via crypts
	5. cat scratch disease
		* stellar-shaped granuloma
### Caseating
* characteristic of TB and fungal infections 
	* AFB stain looks for TB 
	* GMS stain looks for fungal infections
