# Primary Immunodeficiency
## DiGeorge Syndrome 
* developmental failure of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches due to a 22q11 microdeletion 8
* presents with:
	* T-cell deficiency (due to lack of thymus)
		* leads to recurrent infections
	* hypocalcemia (due to lack of parathyroid and thus PTH)
	* heart, great vessels, and face abnormalities
## Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
* defective cell-mediated and humoral immunity 
* has several etiologies:
	1. cytokine receptor defects
		* drive the maturation of the chronic inflammatory state
	2. adenosine deaminase deficiency
		* build up of adenosine is toxic for lymphocytes 
	3. MHC II deficiency 
		* defective function of B and T cells
* clinical characteristics include:
	* increased fungal, viral, bacterial, and protozoal infections
	* increased opportunistic infections including those from live vaccines
* treatment is sterile isolation with eventual stem cell transplant
	* stem cells will generate normal B and T cells
## X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia
* X-linked disease marked by a loss of gamma-immunoglobulin in the blood due to disordered B-cell maturation that prevents plasma cell formation
* due to a x-linked mutation in Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)
	* necessary for B-cell --> plasma cell maturation
* presentation includes:
	* bacterial, enteroviral (mucosal IgA), and Giardia (mucosal IgA) infections
		* due to lack of IgG preventing proper opsonization
	* usually presents after 6 months of life due to mother's immunity for the first 6 months 
	* live vaccines (such as polio) must be avoided
## Common Variable Immunodeficiency
* low immunoglobulin due to B-cell or Th defects
* increased risk for bacterial, enteroviral, or Giardia infections in late childhood (asymptomatic)
* increased risk of autoimmune disease and lymphoma later in life
## IgA Deficiency 
* the most common Ig deficiency presenting with low serum and mucosal IgA leading to increased risk of mucosal infections, especially viral ones 
* **Celiacs disease** presents with a deficiency in IgA
## Hyper-IgM Syndrome
* characterized by elevated IgM due to a mutation in the CD40 pathway
* B-cells can be activated by presentation of an antigen on MHC II with a 2nd CD40-CD40L signal for class switching
* mutations in CD40 or CD40L prevent class switching leading to low IgA, IgG, and IgE
	* presents with recurrent pyogenic infections (IgG), especially at mucosal sites (IgA)
## Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome 
* characterized by the triad of thromobocytopenia (increased bleeding), eczema, and recurrent infections due to defective humoral and cellular immunity 
* due to a X-linked mutation in the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) gene 
## Complement Deficiencies
### C5-C9 Deficiency
* increased risk for Neisseria infections
### C1 Inhibitor Deficiency
* hereditary angioedema characterized by edema of skin in the periorbital and mucosal surfaces 
* overactation of C1 leads to overactivation of complement which ledas to acute inflammation (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, etc.)
