		* tolerance can occur centrally in the thymus or bone marrow
			* *AIRE* mutation leads to **autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome**
				* negative selection occurs in the medulla of the thymus by testing againsting self-antigen on dendritic cells 
				* *AIRE* is necessary for expression of some self-antigens 
				* classically triad is:
					1. hypoparathyroidism
					2. adrenal insufficiency
