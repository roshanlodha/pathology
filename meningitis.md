# Meningitis
* inflammation of the leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia)
* most commonly due to infectious agent
	* neonates: GBS, E. Coli, L. monocytogenes
		* GBS and E. Coli can come from the mother's vaginal canal
	* children and teenagers: N. meningitidis from the nasopharynx
	* adults and elderly: Strep pneumo 
	* nonvaccinated infants: H flu
	* viral: Coxsackievirus (fecal-oral)
	* immunocompromised: Fungi
* classic triad: headache, neck stiffness, and fever
* photophobia (viral), altered mental status
* diagnosed with lumbar puncture between L4/L5 (spinal chord ends at L2 but sub-arachnoid space does not and will not pierce the pia)
	* bacterial - neutrophils with low glucose and positive gram stain and culture
	* viral - lymphocytes with normal CSF glucose due to lack of consumption
	* fungal - lymphocytes with low CSF glucose 
* complications (death from hernation, hydrocephalus, hearing loss, and seizures) are seen most commonly with bacterial meningitis
